Scenario
This  scenario  covers  sports  leagues  where  teams  of  players  compete  against  each  other, 
such as in football.  
A  league  (e.g.  English  Premier  League)  consists  of  a  fixed  number  of  clubs.  Throughout  a 
season of the league each club plays each other club and the result is recorded. Each club is 
awarded points for each match depending on the result, e.g. in football you get three points 
for winning, one for drawing and none for losing. At the end of the season the club with the 
most points wins the league. If two clubs have the same number of points, they are ranked 
by  goal  difference,  which  is  the  total  number  of  goals  they  have  scored  minus  the  total 
number of goals they have conceded.  
Each  club  (e.g.  Newcastle  United)  has  a  squad  of  players,  the  size  of  which  may  vary  from 
club to club. For each match that the club plays a team is selected from the squad. The team 
is always of a fixed size e.g. eleven in football.  
Each player (e.g. Leon Best) has a date of birth and a height, and plays for one club. At the 
end  of a  league  season, the  player  who has  scored the most  goals  (i.e. has  the  largest  goal 
tally) wins the Golden Boot trophy.
